	 * 1. Create a Java class named "Person" with the following instance variables:
	 * name (String) age (int) gender (char) height (double) Create a constructor
	 * for the Person class that takes in the name, age, gender, and height as
	 * parameters and initializes the instance variables. Create a main method that
	 * creates two instances of the Person class using the constructor and prints
	 * out their information. Questions: 1. What is the purpose of a constructor in
	 * Java? 2. How does a constructor differ from a regular method in Java? 3. Can
	 * a Java class have multiple constructors? If so, how are they differentiated?
	 * 4. What happens if a constructor is not defined in a Java class? If you donâ€™t
	 * implement any constructor in your class, the Java compiler inserts default
	 * constructor into your code on your behalf. You will not see the default
	 * constructor in your source code (the .java file) as it is inserted during
	 * compilation and present in the bytecode (.class file). 5. Can a constructor
	 * call other methods or constructors within the same class?
